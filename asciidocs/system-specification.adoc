== Pflichtenheft "Was mache ich"


=== Initial situation

The HTL Leonding is an HTL in Upper Austria. Central room with around 1400 students and the specialist departments
Media technology, IT, electronics and medical technology.In the scope of the IT departments
and media technology, the subject of databases (DBI / INSY) is taught.
An essential part of this course is the practical training in the database query language SQL.


=== Present situation

At the HTL Leonding an Oracle database is available to the students in order to be able to work with a database.
The teacher provides exercises for the students to perform.
There are already various exercise tools that can be found on the Internet.
However, these are mostly static and you can only learn the existing exercises.
In addition, the overview of the level of knowledge is not very clear. Also, you often have to pay for these tools to
use them.

=== Problem

In addition to the tasks provided by the teachers, it is advantageous for the students to be able to prepare for the
exams with additional tasks.
The teachers often provide additional examples, but sometimes without solutions.
